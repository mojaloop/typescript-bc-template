 NOTE:  Use the ExampleTypes notation below when possible instead of enums
        Typescript enums generate js code that is not just types, which
        is what "declare type" does.

        By using only types and interfaces, we can register this dependency
        as a pure types lib and "put" it in the devDependencies section of
        the consuming package.json
